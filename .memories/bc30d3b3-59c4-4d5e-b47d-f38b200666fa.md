# Technical Analysis Framework

Core principles for AI interaction analysis:

1. Focus on system architecture impacts
   - Track workflow modifications
   - Document dependency changes
   - Monitor control path alterations

2. Measurement criteria
   - Process step counts
   - Response time changes
   - System dependency growth
   - Control path modifications

3. Documentation requirements
   - Before/after architecture states
   - Workflow modification details
   - System boundary changes
   - Access path alterations
